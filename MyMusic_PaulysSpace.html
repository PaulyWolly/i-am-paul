      <p style="color: #fff" class="text">
        As an artist, one of the many ways I express myself is through music. I have been a musician ever since I was 15. I get "melody" ideas all the time and when I do I try to write them down. Sometimes they come to me like a flood of creativity that ends up becoming a musical composition. Sometimes they are only fragments of ideas that may come together as a composition at a later time.



        My favorite musical instrument is the guitar, and I have an Ovation acoustic I have played for over 20 years, and a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar, I have been playing for over 15 years. I also "hear" in my head... other instruments, and my secondary favorites are the bass guitar and drums. I love how all the instruments can come together to create a beautiful expression that can flow like water through your fingertips or take you to a place of tranquility. In many of my musical compositions, you will hear multiple guitars, bass, and drum tracks. In others, you may hear only one guitar with an accompaniment of bass and drums and in other compositions, you will hear a complete composition with guitar, bass, drums, and vocals.



        I am also a singer-songwriter and I have written some compositions with complete vocals and vocal harmonies. On occasion, I do creative writing that can come out as poetry, and sometimes this expression comes out as a song with lyrics, verses, choruses, harmonies, and breaks. The beauty of composition is wonderous, and having a multi-track recorder offers a limitless way of composing and rendering musical ideas.



        When I listen to music I "hear" all the parts played as it creates the tapestry of sound. I am so overjoyed to be able to express myself in this way and I hope you will find some part of it that gives you peace, or makes you tap your foot, or brings a smile to your face.



        Mostly I am happy to share a piece of who I am. I hope you enjoy this page of My Music.
